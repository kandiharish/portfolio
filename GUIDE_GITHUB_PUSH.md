# How to Push Your Code to GitHub 🚀

Run these commands one by one in your terminal:

## 1. Initialize Git (If you haven't)
```bash
git init
```

## 2. Add All Files
```bash
git add .
```

## 3. Commit Your Changes
```bash
git commit -m "Final portfolio polish: Recruiter feedback & EmailJS"
```

## 4. Create a New Repository on GitHub
1.  Go to [GitHub.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2.  Name it `portfolio-v2` (or whatever you like).
3.  Click **Create repository**.

## 5. Link and Push
Copy the commands GitHub gives you under "…or push an existing repository from the command line", which look like this:

```bash
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/kandiharish/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```

*(Replace `YOUR-REPO-NAME` with the actual name you created)*

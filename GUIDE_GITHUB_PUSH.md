# How to Update Your Code on GitHub 🔄

Since you have already set up the repository, you just need to save the new changes.

Run these 3 commands in your terminal:

## 1. Stage the Changes
```bash
git add .
```
*(This tells Git: "I moved files, please track the new locations")*

## 2. Commit the Changes
```bash
git commit -m "Fix: Move images to public folder"
```

## 3. Push to GitHub
```bash
git push
```

**Note**: Vercel will automatically detect this push and redeploy your site within a minute! 🚀
